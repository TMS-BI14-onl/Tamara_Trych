All can be done in one query. For example:
SELECT man.first_name, man.cast_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) as cnt_of_emp
FROM employees man, employees emp ON man.employee_id=emp.manager_id
GROUP BY man.first_name, man.cast_name
HAVING COUNT(emp.employee_id)>6

No need in the subquery. You can order by something without having it in the SELECT.
