You got incorrect result because of WHERE clause.
Why do you need it? There is nothing about it in the task.
Also, join is always more preferable than subquery.
Correct answer:
SELECT p.Name, COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) as cnt
FROM Production.Product p JOIN sales.SpecialOfferProduct sp ON p.ProductID=sp.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Name
HAVING COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) >1
